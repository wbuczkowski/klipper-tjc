klipper_tjc
============
A python project that connects a TJC display to [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/)

The display i'm using here is a *DMG80480C043_02WTRZ07* (Stock Display of Anycubic Vyper 3D-Printer) which has a resolution 480x800. For this Display you can find the TJC Project in the *dgus_project* folder.

For Displays with other resolution, the Project must be recreated.

**WARNING: 
This project is still under development and needs to be tested properly by a larger user base.
It has been tested by a few people, so most should be stable, but may happen for you that some 
errors or problems occur.

Please keep that in mind when you this project.
